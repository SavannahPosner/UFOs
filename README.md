### Overview of the analysis

This web page provides an in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings. This includes adding filters to the form allowing the user to filter for multiple criteria at a time. This gives users more flexibility and freedom to select information that applies to their interests. In addition to the date filter; city, state, country, and shape filters have been added. 
### Results:
 
To perform the search simply enter in the data that your are looking for, within the format provided, and press the filter table button. The table will then show the data that meets the provided requirements. If no data appears, that means that none of the data met the requirements.

### Summary 
o One drawback of this webpage is the lack of data. It wouldn’t be uncommon to get no data when filtering. 
o In the future, more data should be acquired. This could potentially provide more resources to establish patterns, which is the point in applying filters. 

o Secondly, establishing graphs based on the data provided would aid in visualizing the data provided. A pie graph displaying where the majority of the UFO’s were sighted, a bar graph displaying different ranges of duration, and a line graph showing the amount of UFO sightings over time would all aid in establishing patterns.
